Project Background
AtliQ Mart, a prominent retail chain operating over 50 supermarkets in Southern India, conducted a large-scale promotional campaign during the festive seasons of Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. These campaigns featured discounts on AtliQ-branded products, including popular offers like "Buy One Get One Free" (BOGOF), percentage-based discounts, and cashback deals. The primary objective of these promotions was to boost sales, attract new customers, and maximize revenue during the festive period.

However, after the campaign, the sales director, Bruce Haryali, sought actionable insights into the performance of these promotions. Specifically, he wanted to identify which promotional strategies were most effective and which fell short. Due to the pressing need for insights and the unavailability of the analytics manager, Tony, the task was delegated to Peter Pandey, a data analyst at AtliQ Mart. Leveraging the companyâ€™s sales and campaign data, Peter performed a detailed analysis to inform future promotional strategies.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the performance of AtliQ Mart's festive season promotions using historical sales data. Key goals include:

Identifying successful promotions: Determine which promotional types drove the highest sales growth.
Evaluating city-wise store distributions: Analyze the number of stores operating in different cities to understand regional influences.
Measuring revenue impact: Compare revenue before and after promotions to quantify the monetary impact of each campaign.
Assessing category-level performance: Evaluate product categories to identify those with the highest sales uplift during the promotions.
Highlighting top-performing products: Rank individual products based on their revenue growth percentage during the promotional period.
